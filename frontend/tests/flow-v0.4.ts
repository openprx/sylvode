/**
 * `bun --cwd frontend run test:flow-v0.4` -- the command `gates/gate-commands.md`'s v0.4 command
 * bundle names but which had no implementation.
 *
 * Runs the four UI suites that back v0.4's browser-side hard gates and emits one machine-readable
 * verdict:
 *
 *   i18n_zh_en_flow_key_parity          tests/flow-i18n-parity.test.ts
 *   vite_wasm_static_build_and_deep_route tests/flow-static-build-deep-route.test.ts
 *   web_ime_undo_selection_and_sync_state tests/flow-ui-state.test.ts
 *   navigator_keyboard_drag_equivalence tests/flow-navigator-equivalence.test.ts
 *
 * Two of those four gates are only PARTLY automatable, and the JSON says so per gate rather than
 * rounding up. `gate-commands.md`'s v0.4 line "人工 keys：`page_editor`、`navigator_a11y`、
 * `restart_recovery`、`feature_flag`、`forms_regression`" is why: real IME candidate windows,
 * real screen-reader output and real focus rings cannot be asserted from a headless process, and
 * dressing a weak proxy up as the real check would be worse than leaving the row red. Every such
 * check appears as a `skipped` entry naming the manual key that owns it -- a suite with skips is
 * reported as `automation_partial`, never as a clean pass.
 *
 * Exit code: 0 only when every suite has zero failures. Skips do not fail the run (they are
 * declared, not silent) but they do keep the gate's `coverage` below `full`.
 *
 * Environment:
 *   FLOW_V04_REUSE_BUILD=1   reuse an existing `build/` instead of running `bun run build`
 *   FLOW_V04_RESULT_PATH     where to write the JSON (default: <checkout>/.flow-gate/cache/frontend/...)
 *   FLOW_V04_SCRATCH         scratch root for the browser profile and build TMPDIR
