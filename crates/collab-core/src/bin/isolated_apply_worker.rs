//! The isolated-apply worker: a single-purpose process spawned once per
//! `LoroCollabEngine::import_update` call by `collab_core::isolation::host::isolated_apply`
//! (`ADR-0014`, `contracts/limits-v1.md`'s "Isolated decode/apply" table). See
//! `crates/collab-core/src/isolation/host.rs`'s module doc for the overall design.
//!
//! Protocol, over stdin/stdout:
//! 1. Read the harness-envelope request (`[base_len][base][update_len][update]`) off stdin --
//!    unmetered (`ADR-0014` section 1.3 excludes harness envelope deserialization from the
//!    metered window).
//! 2. Load the base document -- also unmetered: it is already-validated state this process is
//!    only rehydrating, analogous to how the calibration host excludes `fork()` itself from its
//!    window.
//! 3. Write `host::RESPONSE_MARKER_BYTE` to stdout and flush -- the unmetered setup phase is now
//!    over. This is the signal `isolation::host::read_response_two_phase` uses to start its own
//!    independent `decode_apply_wall_ms_max` watchdog from the *right* moment (the metered window
//!    is about to open), not from whenever the full response happens to be ready. See
//!    [`write_marker_or_exit`]'s doc comment for why this must happen here and not folded into the
//!    final response write.
//! 4. Arm the CPU-ceiling timer (`SIGPROF`/`ITIMER_PROF`) and the counting allocator. This opens
//!    the metered window.
//! 5. `import_update` the untrusted update, compute the resulting `semantic_snapshot`, and run
//!    `check_snapshot` against the frozen `contracts/limits-v1.md` structural ceilings -- decode +
//!    shape validation, exactly the scope `limits-v1.md`'s "从 decode 前开始计,到 semantic
//!    diff/shape validation 完成结束" describes.
//! 6. Disarm the timer and the counting allocator (closing the window) as soon as step 5 has a
//!    verdict, *before* serializing an accepted result: `export_snapshot` operates on already-
//!    validated in-memory state (the same reasoning that keeps step 2's `load` outside the window),
//!    not on the untrusted input step 5 just finished validating, so it is not part of the budget
//!    that bounds processing that untrusted input.
//! 7. Report the outcome back over stdout as a length/CRC32-framed payload (the marker byte was
//!    already sent in step 3, so this is just the framed payload itself).
//!
//! If the process is killed by `SIGPROF` (step 4/5 overran the CPU ceiling), aborts itself via the
//! counting allocator's rejection path (overran the memory ceiling, `SIGABRT`), or is `SIGKILL`ed
//! by the parent's wall watchdog (overran the wall ceiling), no response frame is ever written --
//! the parent classifies those cases from the exit signal alone (`isolation::host::classify_signal`).
//!
//! Never calls `std::process::exit` or lets a panic unwind past `main` (this workspace denies
//! `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic` in production code, and unwinding through a partially-shared runtime
//! state is not something this process needs to make safe -- every path here terminates through
//! [`respond_and_exit`], which always calls `libc::_exit`).
//!
//! Everything above is Linux-only, the platform matrix `ADR-0014` declares for this boundary. On
//! every other target this binary compiles to a stub `main` that refuses on stderr and exits `2`
//! (see the bottom of this file), so release archives carry the same file set on every platform.
