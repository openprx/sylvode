//! Parent-side orchestration for [`isolated_apply`]: spawns `src/bin/isolated_apply_worker.rs` as
//! a fresh process per call, writes the harness-envelope request, wall-watchdogs the response with
//! an independent `SIGKILL` deadline, and classifies the outcome from the child's exit signal and
//! response frame.
//!
//! # Why a subprocess instead of `ADR-0014`'s fork-no-exec zygote
//!
//! `ADR-0014`'s isolation host (`spikes/collab-shared/src/isolation`) requires the zygote to be
//! genuinely single-threaded at every `fork()` call -- verified against `/proc/self/task`, not
//! assumed from startup ordering (`ADR-0014` section 10). That precondition cannot hold here:
//! `apps/api` is a multi-threaded Tokio server, and by the time any request reaches this write
//! path the process already has many OS threads. `fork()`ing from such a thread would either be
//! refused by that same single-threadedness check (correctly, since it is not actually true) or,
//! if attempted anyway, be unsound for the exact reason `ADR-0014` gives for why fork-only-from-
//! single-threaded *is* safe: at the fork point there must be exactly one thread, so no lock held
//! by another thread is left in an inconsistent state in the child. Pre-forking a dedicated zygote
//! before Tokio starts would satisfy this, but requires wiring into `apps/api::main` before any
//! runtime thread exists, which is outside this package's (`collab-write-path`) file scope.
//!
//! Spawning a fresh process via [`std::process::Command`] sidesteps the precondition entirely: a
//! freshly `exec`'d process image starts single-threaded regardless of how many threads its parent
//! has, because `Command::spawn` on Linux is `fork` immediately followed by `execve` -- the child
//! never runs any of the parent's code (Tokio's runtime included) between those two calls. This
//! adopts `ADR-0014`'s *online-enforcement* mechanisms over that different process-creation
//! primitive: `SIGPROF`/`setitimer(ITIMER_PROF)` for the CPU ceiling (section 1.1, in
//! `isolation::child_runtime`), a counting `GlobalAlloc` for the memory ceiling (sections 1 and 3,
//! in `isolation::alloc`), and an independent wall-clock watchdog with `SIGKILL` (section 1,
//! below).
//!
//! It does **not** carry over section 2's shared measurement page: that exists to recover
//! forensic peak/cause telemetry from a killed process for *gate evidence*. This production call
//! site has no use for that telemetry -- it only needs a correct accept/reject decision, which it
//! gets from the exit signal alone (`SIGPROF` -> [`IsolatedApplyError::CpuCeiling`], `SIGABRT`
//! (the allocator's own rejection routed through Rust's `handle_alloc_error`) ->
//! [`IsolatedApplyError::MemoryCeiling`], a watchdog-issued `SIGKILL` -> [`IsolatedApplyError::WallCeiling`]).
//!
//! Per `ADR-0014` section 8, the calibration host it comes from is "a v0.3 selection/acceptance
//! facility, not a v0.4 production safety boundary", and production enforcement is scoped to
//! "another ADR". This module *is* that production enforcement for the collab write path -- no
//! v0.3 spike evidence is cited as proof it works; it is a fresh implementation, verified by this
//! module's own tests spawning the real worker binary.
