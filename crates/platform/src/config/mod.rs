//! File backed configuration for every Sylvode binary.
//!
//! Sylvode reads no environment variables. One TOML file, divided into sections, configures the
//! API, the worker and the MCP server; each binary consumes the sections it needs and ignores the
//! rest. The file is located by an explicit path only — a `--config <path>` flag, or
//! [`DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH`] relative to the process working directory — so a deployment is never
//! configured by something that happened to be exported into the process environment.
//!
//! # Loading
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use platform::config::{AppConfig, OpenPrConfig};
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), platform::error::AppError> {
//! // `explicit` is whatever `--config` carried, or `None`.
//! let explicit: Option<std::path::PathBuf> = None;
//! let config = OpenPrConfig::load(explicit.as_deref())?;
//! let cfg = AppConfig::from_config(&config, "api", "0.0.0.0:8081")?;
//! # let _ = cfg;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Failure behaviour
//!
//! A missing file is an error, never a silent fallback to defaults: a service that starts with an
//! invented configuration is a service that starts with the wrong database and the wrong signing
//! key. Validation collects *every* unusable value before returning, so one round of edits fixes
//! the whole file.
//!
//! # Eager shape, lazy presence
//!
//! Loading validates the *shape* of every value the file does contain, and refuses the file if
//! any of them is unusable. Whether a *mandatory* value is present is decided by the binary that
//! needs it, through [`OpenPrConfig::database_runtime`], [`OpenPrConfig::auth_runtime`] and
//! [`OpenPrConfig::mcp_runtime`]: one file serves three binaries, and the MCP server reaches the
//! API over HTTP without ever opening a database connection or signing a token. Requiring
//! `database.url` and `auth.jwt_secret` at load time forced an MCP-only deployment to invent two
//! credentials it never uses, which is worse than useless — an invented database URL is a real
//! connection string pointing somewhere unintended.
//!
//! A binary that does need a section still fails to start without it: the accessors report every
//! missing value of the section at once, and [`AppConfig::from_config`] — the API's and the
//! worker's single entry point — reports the missing database *and* auth values together.
