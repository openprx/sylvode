## Workflow: Bug Report
1. files.upload -> upload log/screenshot
2. work_items.create -> create issue with attachments
3. work_items.add_label -> tag it
4. comments.create -> add context

## Workflow: Sprint Planning
1. sprints.create -> create sprint
2. work_items.list -> review backlog
3. work_items.update -> assign and set state

## Field Values
- state: any key of the project workflow (default set: backlog | todo | in_progress | done); omit on create to use the workflow's initial state
- priority: low | medium | high | urgent
- attachments: array of URLs from files.upload
- decimal/amount form fields: send decimal strings, never JSON numbers
- list tools are paginated: read pagination_hint / total_pages before summarising

## Authorization
Every call is checked against the agent policy of the project that owns the data.
Ids must be canonical UUIDs. Do not send a project_id that does not own the target:
the real owner is read back from the API and a mismatch is refused.

These tools currently refuse every call, because the API exposes no way to read the
owning project of the object they address, so their policy cannot be evaluated:
form_attachments.archive, form_attachments.restore (needs GET /api/v1/form-attachments/{attachment_id}),
sprints.update, sprints.delete (needs GET /api/v1/sprints/{sprint_id}),
comments.delete (needs GET /api/v1/comments/{comment_id}).

Workspace wide tools carry no owning project and are therefore not filtered by a
project policy: projects.list, projects.create, project_types.*, scenario_templates.list,
scenario_templates.get, members.list, search.all, work_items.search, files.upload,
proposals.get, labels.create, labels.list, labels.update, labels.delete, flow.feature_get.

flow.feature_set and legacy_pages.* are also workspace wide, and additionally require the
calling bot/user to be a workspace admin with Flow admin capability, checked against an
explicit workspace_id the caller supplies (never a configured default). flow.feature_set is
gated by three independent layers: this server's own tool policy (only this exact tool
name, PolicyScope::WorkspaceWideAdmin), a genuine pre-flight admin-capability probe against
the API, and the target REST route's own workspace-admin check, which remains the authority
of record. legacy_pages.* only get the tool-policy layer today, because the API exposes no
legacy-pages admin REST surface at all yet; they always refuse locally regardless. objects.get and objects.history are governed by the project agent
policy of the Flow object's owning project when it has one, and are workspace wide (no
project policy) when it does not. objects.query accepts a project_id but does not require
one: pass project_id to be governed by that project's policy, or unprojected=true to list
objects that belong to no project workspace wide.
