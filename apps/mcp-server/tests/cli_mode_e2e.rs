//! End-to-end proof that the binary's CLI mode works, against the shipped binary and a
//! counting stand-in for the Sylvode API.
//!
//! The same executable is a server and a command line client, and the CLI half has no MCP
//! client in front of it to make its mistakes obvious: a human types a command and reads what
//! comes back on stdout and stderr. What that half owes its user is therefore not only correct
//! results but correct *refusals* — a missing argument, an unusable credential and an absent
//! configuration file each have to say what went wrong and what to do about it, without
//! leaking anything about the backend.
//!
//! The unit tests in `cli.rs` already check that the argument grammar parses. They cannot check
//! any of the above, because they never run the binary: nothing there reaches a config loader,
//! an API call or a process exit status. So every test here spawns the real executable with a
//! real configuration file, in a working directory that deliberately holds no
//! `config/openpr.toml` — a command that failed to pick up its `--config` would fail with
//! "configuration file not found" rather than silently falling back onto some file that
//! happened to be there.
//!
//! Assertions are made against the counting stand-in wherever the question is *what the CLI
//! did*, not merely what it printed: whether a refusal happened before any call went out,
//! which credential a call carried, and how many calls one command is worth.
