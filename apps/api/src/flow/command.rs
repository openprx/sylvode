//! The write paths this package ships: `POST .../flow/objects` (object creation) and
//! `POST .../flow/objects/{id}/commands` (`set_title|insert_block|update_block|delete_block|
//! move_block|semantic_patch|archive|restore` plus v0.6's Collection family).
//!
//! The six content types share the *exact* write path `flow::collab::write::accept_update` and
//! the WebSocket `update` frame use (hydrate/isolated-apply outside any lock, the per-document
//! coordinator, the commit-time `authz_epoch` fence, the document row lock) — this module only
//! turns a command payload into the same shape of CRDT update bytes a WebSocket client would have
//! produced locally, then calls the identical function. `archive`/`restore` never advance a
//! document head (`existing_document_cardinality = 0`, `rest-api-v1.md`'s `move_object`/`link`
//! commentary on the same rule), so they take no document coordinator and no document row lock.
//! They lock the actual server-derived `flow_objects` impact set (the root and its subtree),
//! re-derive that set inside the transaction, and still take the commit-time
//! `authz_epoch` fence (`ADR-0012` §3.1, `authz::fence_epoch_for_share`)
//! inside that transaction: the fence's job is authorization freshness, not document-head
//! consistency, so "no document head to advance" does not imply "no epoch to re-verify" — see
//! `execute_lifecycle_command`'s own doc comment for the TOCTOU window this closes.

        //   `Some(other_project)` under a projected one — the child's ordering entry would land in
        //   a different navigator document from its parent's, which is exactly the two-navigator
        //   subtree the invariant exists to prevent.
        // - **Declared and equal** passes untouched.
        // - **Omitted** inherits. Reading omission as "the caller declared the unprojected scope"
        //   would reject the most ordinary request there is ("new child page under this page") and
        //   would be the server picking a scope the caller never named — `rest-api-v1.md`'s "不得
        //   把省略解释成另一个 scope" forbids precisely that.
