//! Snapshot advancement (gate 7 `minimal_snapshot_advancement_bounds_tail`): keeps
//! `collab_documents.snapshot`/`snapshot_seq` caught up to `head_seq` so a document's tail
//! (`collab_updates` rows with `seq > snapshot_seq`) and decoded bootstrap size (`snapshot` bytes
//! + tail bytes) stay under `limits-v1.md`'s frozen soft/hard triggers.
//!
//! `versions/v0.4-flow-alpha.md:29` is explicit about what this module does and does not do: it
//! *advances* the snapshot pointer forward — it never deletes a `collab_updates` row. Every
//! update this package has ever accepted for a document stays readable at its original `seq`
//! after any number of advancements; only `snapshot`/`snapshot_frontier`/`snapshot_seq` move.
//! Retention/compaction — deleting rows below some horizon — is out of scope before v0.8 ("旧
//! update 全部保留，v0.8 前不做 compaction/retention delete"), and this module contains no
//! `DELETE` statement anywhere. Do not confuse the two: "no compaction before v0.8" is a
//! statement about deletion, not about whether the snapshot pointer may move.
//!
//! Lock discipline (`ADR-0010`, `collab-protocol-v1.md`): [`build_candidate`] does every
//! expensive step — the [`bootstrap::load`] read, the CRDT decode/replay, the snapshot export,
//! and the round-trip validation decode — with no transaction open at all. [`commit_candidate`]
//! is the only function here that opens one, and it does nothing between `begin` and `commit` but
//! a `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` boundary/head recheck and, if it still matches, one fixed `UPDATE` —
//! no engine call, no cache call, no network I/O, mirroring `write::run_locked_phase` exactly.
