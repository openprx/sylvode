//! `ADR-0012` §3 effective-permission computation and §3.1 commit-time `authz_epoch` fencing.
//!
//! The v0.5 authorization surface writes `flow_object_grants`, inheritance, workspace baselines,
//! and workspace membership. This module supplies both their effective-permission evaluator and
//! their commit-time epoch fencing primitives. The collab WebSocket layer must (a) compute the
//! *read* side of the same effective-permission rule so ticket issuance and `open` gate on it
//! today, using whatever `flow_object_grants` rows/`inherit_from_parent` flags a v0.5 admin
//! surface — or a direct SQL seed in a test — puts there, and (b) enforce the commit-time fencing
//! barrier so that whenever *something* advances `flow_workspace_settings.authz_epoch` (the v0.5
//! `grant/membership/parent_id` write path), an in-flight content write cannot straddle that change
//! and land after the revocation. [`advance_epoch`] is the strict primitive for Flow-native
//! authorization changes, while [`advance_epoch_if_present`] lets general workspace-member routes
//! participate without creating Flow settings for workspaces that have never enabled Flow.
