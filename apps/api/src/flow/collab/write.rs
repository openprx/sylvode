//! The server write algorithm: `ADR-0010`'s "写入算法" / `collab-protocol-v1.md`'s "服务端写入顺序",
//! including the commit-time `authz_epoch` fencing barrier (`ADR-0012` §3.1) and the document row
//! lock (`ADR-0010`).
//!
//! ```text
//! validate update bytes under limits (before any engine state is allocated)
//!   -> [layer 0] acquire the instance-local document coordinator
//!   -> hydrate/rebase the warm cache to the observed DB head, outside any lock
//!   -> isolated apply (spawned worker: import_update + semantic_snapshot + check_snapshot,
//!      `collab_core::isolation::isolated_apply`) + projection prepare, outside any lock
//!   -> begin transaction, SET LOCAL lock_timeout/statement_timeout
//!   -> [layer 1] SELECT authz_epoch ... FOR SHARE, held to commit; CAS against checked_epoch
//!   -> SELECT collab_documents ... FOR UPDATE
//!   -> if locked head != prepared head: rollback, bounded rebase outside the lock
//!   -> allocate seq; insert update + head + projection + business event + event_dispatch
//!   -> commit
//!   -> publish best-effort fanout notice; update the warm cache to the committed head
//! ```
//!
//! Lock-content discipline (`collab-protocol-v1.md`: "锁内严禁 snapshot/tail load、CRDT apply、
//! semantic diff、projection compute、网络 I/O 或等待 async mutex"): every decode, isolated apply,
//! `semantic_snapshot`, and projection JSON/plain-text render happens in [`hydrate_and_apply`],
//! which returns *before* [`run_locked_phase`] ever calls `db.begin()`. The decode/apply/shape-
//! validate step itself (`import_update` + `semantic_snapshot` + `collab_core::limits::
//! check_snapshot`) runs inside a resource-ceilinged worker process spawned by
//! `collab_core::isolation::isolated_apply` (`ADR-0014`; see `crates/collab-core/src/isolation/
//! host.rs`'s module doc), not in this process at all. The only work [`run_locked_phase`] does is
//! the epoch fence, the row lock, the head-match recheck, and the fixed, parameterized
//! inserts/updates — no engine call, no cache call, and no broadcast happen inside it or between
//! its `begin`/`commit`.
//!
//! Broadcasting `accepted` happens in [`accept_update`] itself, strictly after commit but still
//! before this function returns — i.e. still while the caller's [`DocumentCoordinator`] permit is
//! held (`accept_update`'s own doc comment on why `_permit` stays alive for its whole body). This
//! is deliberate, not incidental: `collab-protocol-v1.md`'s "accepted 出站顺序" requires broadcasts
//! for one document to reach [`super::registry::SessionRegistry`] in commit order, and the
//! coordinator permit is the only thing in this instance that actually serializes writers for one
//! `document_id`. Broadcasting *after* `accept_update` returns — the shape this module shipped
//! with through v0.4's early builds — drops that serialization exactly where it matters: two
//! commits for the same document can each finish (commit + release the permit) before either one
//! reaches the registry, and normal async scheduling gives no guarantee the one that committed
//! first also broadcasts first. Enqueuing to [`super::registry::SessionRegistry`]'s
//! `mpsc::UnboundedSender` is a fast, synchronous, in-memory operation, not the network I/O or
//! blocking work the lock-content discipline above forbids inside the *database* row lock — the
//! coordinator permit is a separate, lighter-weight admission gate `coordinator.rs`'s own doc
//! comment already says exists "purely to serialize same-instance writers", so extending its hold
//! this far is within its documented purpose.
