//! The server-side origin every Flow command stamps onto the events it produces.
//!
//! `events-v1.md`'s envelope
//! `source:{surface,attestation,session?,tool?,request?,client_id?,service?}` plus
//! the two causal-chain fields `correlation_id` / `causation_id`.
//!
//! # Why this is a type and not a `json!` literal at each producer
//!
//! `events-v1.md` freezes: "`source` 由服务端按 Web/REST/MCP/CLI/worker 覆盖，沿用 MCP origin
//! contract" and "首个用户请求生成 `correlation_id`；由 command、job、worker 或 retry 导出的下一
//! 事件把直接父 event id 写 `causation_id` 并继承 correlation".
//!
//! Both clauses are about the *caller*, not about the producer. A producer that writes
//! `json!({ "surface": "rest" })` inline is not implementing them — it is asserting that its only
//! caller will ever be REST. The moment `mcp-surface-v1.md`'s three transports or
//! `cli-surface-v1.md`'s two reuse the same command path (they are contractually required to:
//! "MCP、CLI、Web 必须调用本契约，不得增加 DB 直连或私有 endpoint"), that assertion becomes a
//! silent lie in the audit stream — no error, no rejection, just every operation recorded as REST
//! forever. Audit data cannot be repaired after the fact, so the caller has to be able to *say*
//! its surface before those callers exist, not after.
//!
//! # Deliberately not `Deserialize`
//!
//! `rest-api-v1.md`: "服务端忽略 caller 自报 actor，以认证 context 生成 actor/origin/causation",
//! and `events-v1.md`: "不适用时省略且**不能填 caller 自报值**". Nothing here may be built from a
//! request body, so none of these types derive `Deserialize` and none is reachable from a wire
//! shape. Every value is produced by trusted server code at the transport boundary.
