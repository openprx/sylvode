//! `move_object` — the cross-parent (and cross-project) governance command, and the **first and
//! only** command in the frozen v0.5 set whose *contended existing document set* can exceed one
//! (`ADR-0013` §1's third table row). Everything in `ADR-0013` §2 that v0.4 wrote down but never
//! executed runs here for the first time.
//!
//! What it is, in one paragraph: `parent_id` is `PostgreSQL`'s (`ADR-0012` §1), so re-parenting is
//! a governance row write, not a CRDT edit — but the navigator documents that hold *ordering*
//! (`ADR-0012` §1: "navigator CRDT document 此后只持有排序（position key）与显示元数据") must be
//! rewritten on both sides of the move, and those are canonical CRDT documents with heads. So one
//! transaction advances up to two existing document heads, rewrites two `flow_objects` governance
//! columns, writes the events, and bumps `authz_epoch` — atomically, with no compensation
//! (`ADR-0013` §3: single `PostgreSQL` transaction, explicitly no saga/2PC).
//!
//! ## The two lock layers (`ADR-0013` §2.1, as corrected by R16)
//!
//! ```text
//! layer 0 (before the transaction, in-process): the document coordinator, ascending document_id
//! layer 1 (in transaction): flow_workspace_settings.authz_epoch          FOR UPDATE
//! layer 2 (in transaction): flow_objects (moved object + target chain)   FOR UPDATE, ascending id
//! layer 3 (in transaction): collab_documents (the contended set)         FOR UPDATE, ascending id
//! layer 4 (in transaction): business_events / event_dispatch
//! ```
//!
//! Both ordered layers derive their order from the *same* function,
//! [`super::collab::coordinator::ascending_document_lock_order`] — R16's correction is that
//! ordering only the database rows is not enough, because the instance-local coordinator is taken
//! first and a `(A,B)` / `(B,A)` pair there deadlocks in **tokio**, where `PostgreSQL`'s deadlock
//! detector cannot see it. Sharing one ordering function is what makes "coordinator order ==
//! database order" a property of the code rather than a rule to remember.
//!
//! ## Why layer 1 is `FOR UPDATE`, and why the barrier is re-verification rather than a fence
//!
//! A content write fences with `FOR SHARE` (`authz::fence_epoch_for_share`) so writes do not
//! serialize against each other. `move_object` cannot use that lock: it changes `parent_id`, which
//! `ADR-0012` §3.1 point 1 lists as an authorization change, so it must also *advance* the epoch
//! before committing — and `FOR SHARE` followed by an `UPDATE` of the same row is a lock upgrade
//! that two such transactions deadlock on. It takes `authz::lock_epoch_for_update` instead, as the
//! first statement of the transaction, exactly like `flow::grants`.
//!
//! Holding the conflicting lock makes an epoch *comparison* the wrong barrier as well as an
//! unnecessary one. `rest-api-v1.md` spells the alternative out — "再取文档行锁并**在锁内重验有效
//! 权限**" — and that is what happens here: both sides of `ADR-0012` §4's double-sided rule are
//! re-evaluated on this transaction's own snapshot, after the epoch row is held. A comparison
//! would reject whenever *anything* in the workspace changed the epoch first (including an
//! unrelated move); re-verification decides on the truth instead, which is strictly stronger and
//! never manufactures a false `policy_rejected`. Both the epoch this command checked permission
//! against outside the transaction and the epoch it committed are still reported in
//! `command_result`, which is what the `authz_linearization_no_escalation` gate artifact asks for.
//!
//! **A consequence worth stating out loud, because it changes what the lock-order gate can
//! observe:** since every `move_object` in a workspace takes that one row exclusively as its first
//! locked action, two concurrent moves in the same workspace are already fully serialized *before*
//! either reaches layer 3. The reversed-order document deadlock the ADR warns about is therefore
//! unreachable between two moves at the database layer — the reachable one is the layer-0
//! coordinator deadlock, which happens before any transaction exists. That is exactly the case
//! R16 added, and it is the one this package's tests construct deterministically.

///   it is by carrying a subtree down with it. Navigator ordering entries are flat, so

///   `DeleteNode` has no ceiling at all (`check_operation` returns `Ok` for it unconditionally).
///
/// **What the `index.parents` guard is and is not**, written down rather than left as a line no
/// test can see. It *runs* whenever a navigator holds a nested node — navigator documents are
/// ordinary collab documents and nothing forbids that — so it is not dead. But it cannot *fail*
/// on a document that already satisfies `tree_depth_max`: the operation moves the entry to the
/// root, so `deepest_after_move = 0 + subtree_height(entry)`, and in a valid document an entry at
/// depth `d` has `d + height <= 32`, hence `height <= 32`. A move to the root only ever reduces
/// depths. It is therefore defence in depth against a document that is **already** over the
/// ceiling, and `a_navigator_entry_carrying_an_over_deep_subtree_is_refused_by_the_batched_depth_check`
/// builds exactly that document so the branch is falsifiable rather than merely argued about.
/// The guard is kept rather than replaced by an unconditional call because `check_operation`'s
