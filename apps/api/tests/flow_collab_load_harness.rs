//! Sylvode Flow v0.4 collab **10-client load harness** — the measurement facility
//! `gates/gate-commands.md`'s v0.4 "Architecture verifier" paragraph and
//! `decisions/ADR-0010-collab-server-architecture.md` §"量化接受与推翻门槛" require and that
//! `scripts/verify-flow-collab-architecture.sh` has, until now, correctly reported as a build gap
//! (its `load_harness_grep` found zero hits under `apps/` and `crates/`).
//!
//! Two hard gates are blocked on it:
//!
//! - `bounded_warm_cache_lock_hold_and_round_trip_budgets` — needs the two *distribution*
//!   statistics the frozen hard-ceiling constants (`DOCUMENT_LOCK_WAIT_MS_MAX` = 100 ms,
//!   `DOCUMENT_LOCK_HOLD_MS_MAX` = 100 ms, `MAX_REBASE_ATTEMPTS` = 3) cannot express:
//!   **lock hold p95 ≤ 25 ms** and **10-client accepted round-trip p95 ≤ 250 ms**.
//! - `bootstrap_repeatable_read_and_ws_parity` — needs a REST/WS 10-client concurrent load
//!   harness proving the same `REPEATABLE READ` view and cross-surface `seq`/hash/frontier parity
//!   with no gaps.
//!
//! # What this harness actually is
//!
//! A real `axum::serve` listener on `127.0.0.1:0` wired the way `apps/api/src/main.rs` wires the
//! collab routes, backed by a **real, freshly migrated `PostgreSQL` scratch database** (never a mock
//! or in-memory DB — `gate-commands.md` fails a run outright for that), driven by
//! 10 or 50 real `tokio-tungstenite` WebSocket clients that each produce genuine
//! Loro CRDT deltas from their own engine and wait for their own `accepted` frame, plus REST/WS
//! parity probes that run *concurrently with* that write load.
//!
//! # Measurement caliber (the part that decides whether the numbers mean anything)
//!
//! `gate-commands.md` fails a run that "把 replay/apply 计出 hold 但实际留在锁内" — i.e. a
//! self-reported in-process timer that starts and stops wherever the implementation chooses is
//! worth nothing here, because the exact failure being guarded against is the implementation
//! placing work inside the lock and *excluding it from its own timer*. So this harness does not
//! time the lock from inside `apps/api` at all. It reads the lock's lifetime out of
//! **`PostgreSQL`'s own statement log**: the scratch database is switched to
//! `log_min_duration_statement = 0` for the measurement window, so every statement the server
//! issues is logged by the server process with a `%m` timestamp and its own `duration:`, grouped
//! by backend PID. One connection's statements are strictly sequential, so `BEGIN … COMMIT` on one
//! PID reconstructs one write transaction exactly, from an authority that is neither the code
//! under test nor this harness.
//!
//! From that reconstruction come three independent facts, and it takes all three for the
//! "prepare/rebase really is outside the lock" claim to be earned rather than asserted:
//!
//! 1. **Statement inventory.** Every statement executed between `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` is known
//!    exactly (not sampled). [`LOCKED_PHASE_FORBIDDEN_READS`] fails the run if a snapshot load or
//!    a `collab_updates` tail `SELECT` — the hydrate/rebase reads — ever appears inside the write
//!    transaction.
//! 2. **Intra-lock application gap.** For each consecutive statement pair inside a transaction,
//!    the wall time that elapsed while the transaction was open but *no SQL was executing* is the
//!    time the application spent doing something else while holding the lock. A CRDT apply, an
//!    `isolated_apply` worker spawn, a projection render, or a cache call inside the lock all show
//!    up here and nowhere else. Reported as a distribution, asserted against
//!    [`INTRA_LOCK_APP_GAP_MS_MAX`].
//! 3. **A calibrated impossibility check.** The harness separately measures what one real
//!    `collab_core::isolation::isolated_apply` costs on *this* machine and *this* build profile
//!    ([`Report::isolated_apply_ms_p50`]). If the whole locked transaction is shorter than a
//!    single isolated apply, the apply provably is not inside it. This is the check that survives
//!    a machine or profile change, because both sides move together.
//!
//! Measurement resolution: `PostgreSQL`'s `%m` log prefix is millisecond-quantized, so each
//! transaction span carries roughly ±1 ms. That is reported (`hold_ms_resolution`) rather than
//! hidden, and it is small against a 25 ms budget. The span measured is `BEGIN`→`COMMIT`, which is
//! a **superset** of the row-lock hold (the lock is taken a few statements after `BEGIN`), so this
//! caliber can only ever over-report hold — it cannot manufacture a pass.
//!
//! # Honest failure
//!
//! Every check appends to [`Report::violations`] instead of panicking at the first problem, and
//! the full measured distribution is printed before the single final assertion. A red run is
//! supposed to show its numbers.
