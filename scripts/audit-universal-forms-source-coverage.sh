Usage: scripts/audit-universal-forms-source-coverage.sh

Audits that the universal forms delivery surface claimed by the tracker still
has concrete source-code, migration, frontend, MCP, worker, and smoke-test
entrypoints. This is a fast structural gate; behavior is covered by the smoke
and acceptance scripts.
