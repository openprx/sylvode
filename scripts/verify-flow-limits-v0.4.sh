# Sylvode Flow v0.4 limits verifier.
#
# Contract: $SYLVODE_CONTRACTS_ROOT/gates/gate-commands.md, the v0.4
# section's "Limits verifier" paragraph ("Limits verifier 必须对每个
# caller-input 固定上限证明 exact boundary accepted、boundary+1 以正确
# limit_kind rejected、canonical head/event/event_dispatch 行零变化,并覆盖
# isolated CPU/wall/memory、rate/connection/slow queue 以及 Web
# Bootstrap.limits parity"), and contracts/limits-v1.md in full (every
# fixed-value table, the FlowLimitsV1 wire schema, and the v0.4 evidence
# schema for evidence/v0.4/limits-result.json).
#
# Covers 6 hard gates: flow_limits_exact_boundary_and_plus_one_rejection,
# isolated_decode_apply_cpu_wall_memory,
# websocket_rate_connection_and_backpressure_limits,
# bootstrap_limits_web_server_parity, limit_exceeded_kind_coverage,
# dispatch_numeric_budgets_locked.
#
# HOW IT WORKS (three layers, all re-derived from source every run --
# nothing here is a hardcoded verdict):
#
#   1. STATIC: parses every `| \`key\` | value | \`limit_kind\` | ... |`
#      row anywhere in contracts/limits-v1.md (never hand-copied numbers)
#      plus the frozen `FlowLimitsV1 = {...}` wire-schema block, and
#      cross-checks every value against the identically-UPPER_SNAKE-named
#      Rust constant in apps/api/src/flow/collab/limits.rs -- that
#      module's own naming convention makes this a 1:1, no-alias-table
#      cross-check. Also statically greps apps/api/src, crates/collab-core
#      and frontend/src for structural facts this script needs to judge
#      wire-correctness and reachability: whether each limit_kind's
#      enforcement code exists at all outside its own wire-report
#      constant, whether the REST envelope (apps/api/src/error.rs /
#      response.rs) can even carry a `details` object, whether specific
#      rejection call sites pass `details=None` instead of the required
#      `{limit_kind,limit}`, and whether frontend/src/lib/flow/types.ts's
#      FlowLimitsV1 interface's field set matches the server's 36-field
#      wire schema.
#
#   2. DYNAMIC: runs every real cargo test this script found that
#      exercises a limit_kind boundary -- pure-logic exact/+1 tests in
#      crates/collab-core/src/limits.rs and
#      apps/api/src/flow/collab/{registry,snapshot}.rs, plus two
#      DB-backed e2e tests (routes::collab / routes::flow) -- and folds
#      each test's real ok/FAILED status into its boundary_case.
#
#   3. DEFERRAL: `persistence_path` (document lock wait/hold/p95,
#      round-trip p95, rebase exhaustion, snapshot soft/hard triggers) and
#      part of `delivery_path` (no_subscribers reaping,
#      coalescing-cap-starts-new-row) are contractually owned by
#      scripts/verify-flow-collab-architecture.sh and
#      scripts/verify-flow-events-v0.4.sh respectively (limits-v1.md says
#      so explicitly: "这些是...内部架构预算...10-client fixture、cache
#      exact/eviction...写入 evidence/v0.4/collab-architecture-result.json").
#      This script reads those two sibling artifacts IF they exist AND
#      their own `source_head` matches this run's HEAD (a stale or
#      missing sibling is `not_covered`, never silently trusted or
#      re-fabricated), rather than re-running their expensive DB test
#      suites itself.
#
# HONEST RESULT (recorded in the JSON, `passed` forced false while any gap
# below remains open -- this script never rounds a partial result up to a
# pass):
#
#   The contract defines 32 fixed `limit_kind` values, but four package-import
#   kinds have no v0.4 surface and are recorded with the mandatory reason code
#   `not_applicable_until_v0_8`. The other 28 keep the full boundary and
#   caller-reachable wire criteria below; the exemption is an exact allowlist,
#   never an `import_*` wildcard.
#
#   Of the 28 applicable v0.4 `limit_kind` values, this run finds: 6 have a real
#   exact/+1 unit test but the enforcing code
#   (crates/collab-core/src/limits.rs::check_operation*) has ZERO call
#   sites in apps/api/src -- not wired into any endpoint. 2 (presence
#   entries per connection/document) have a real exact/+1 unit test AND
#   are genuinely wired (apps/api/src/flow/collab/registry.rs), but the
#   caller-visible WS rejection (session.rs) sends `details=None` for
#   both, so the wire response can never carry the required `limit_kind`
#   at all. 1 (update_bytes) has a real DB-backed e2e test, is wired on
#   the WS path, but the test uses a 70000-byte oversized update rather
#   than an exact 65536/65537 boundary, the WS details omit the
#   contract-required `limit` field, and the REST path drops `details`
#   entirely (apps/api/src/error.rs's ApiError only ever carries a plain
#   String -- there is no `details` field in the REST envelope at all,
#   for ANY limit_kind, which is why REST can never surface limit_kind
#   for anything). The 3 `isolation` kinds (decode_apply_cpu_ms,
#   decode_apply_wall_ms, isolated_apply_memory_bytes) are wired, not
#   absent: apps/api/src/flow/collab/write.rs's hydrate_and_apply calls
#   collab_core::isolation::isolated_apply(...), whose real enforcement
#   (a wall-clock watchdog, a counting-allocator memory ceiling, and a
#   SIGPROF CPU timer) lives in crates/collab-core/src/isolation/ -- but
#   no test anywhere proves the exact/+1 numeric boundary for any of the
#   three, only a qualitative "eventually kills a pathological input and
#   reports a ceiling" end-to-end test, so all 3 still fail this gate on
#   missing boundary evidence rather than missing enforcement. The
#   remaining 20 have zero enforcement call sites found anywhere outside
#   their own wire-report constant -- verified absent, not merely
#   untested. Most of `connection_rate_queue`, `bootstrap_parity`
#   (frontend's FlowLimitsV1 only declares 10 of 36 fields, 2 of those
#   under different names, and is never fetched from a live Bootstrap
#   response at all) and most of `delivery_path` (most numeric budgets
#   are still `status: unset` in the contract itself) are failed for the
#   same class of reason as those 20: this script CAN check them (and
#   did), and what it finds is either "does not exist" or "exists but is
#   wire-broken" -- never a shrug.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = all 6 gates recomputed to passed (does not happen today
# -- see above), 1 = ran to completion and wrote
# evidence/v0.4/limits-result.json with one or more gates not passed, 2 =

Usage: scripts/verify-flow-limits-v0.4.sh --contract PATH --json [OPTIONS]

Cross-checks every fixed-value row of contracts/limits-v1.md (all four
limit_kind tables plus the FlowLimitsV1 wire schema) against
apps/api/src/flow/collab/limits.rs's constants, statically determines
which limit_kind values have real caller-facing enforcement versus
verified-absent or wire-broken enforcement, runs every real matching
cargo test (crates/collab-core + apps/api, pure-logic and two DB-backed
e2e tests), and defers persistence_path / part of delivery_path to
evidence/v0.4/collab-architecture-result.json and
evidence/v0.4/flow-events-result.json when those are present and
source_head-matched. Writes evidence/v0.4/limits-result.json.

Options:
  --contract PATH          Path to contracts/limits-v1.md. Default:
                          <contracts-root>/contracts/limits-v1.md
                          A relative path is resolved against the
                          current directory first, then against
                          --contracts-root.
  --contracts-root DIR     Root containing contracts/. Default:
                          $SYLVODE_CONTRACTS_ROOT
  --evidence-root DIR     Required. Where limits-result.json is written, and where
                          the sibling collab-architecture-result.json /
                          flow-events-result.json are read from.
  --repo-root DIR         Repository containing apps/api, crates/,
                          frontend/ and the cargo workspace. Default: this
                          checkout.
  --skip-cargo-test        Skip every dynamic cargo test (fast iteration
                          only; the written evidence records this and
                          every boundary_case that needed a dynamic test
                          is treated as failed with dynamic evidence
                          omitted).
  --json                  Required for CLI-contract compatibility.
  -h, --help              Show this help and exit 0.

Exit codes: 0 all 6 gates passed, 1 ran to completion with one or more
gates not passed (the honest, normal outcome today), 2 usage/tool/
environment error or a DB-backed dynamic test was silently skipped
because OPENPR_TEST_DATABASE_URL is not set.

# ---- generic "does a real boundary test exist for this limit_kind" scan ----
#
# Several `limit_kind`s below (isolation, connection/rate/queue, import/scan, websocket_frame_bytes,
# presence_payload_bytes, presence_ttl_seconds, page_size) currently have ZERO enforcement call
# sites at all, so their `status` is unambiguously `failed` regardless of test coverage. But a
# `ref_count > 0` alone (call sites exist) must NEVER be sufficient for `passed` on its own -- that
# would let a future PR wire the check without ever proving the exact/+1 boundary and still turn
# this gate green. So every one of these cases additionally requires a real boundary test: scanned
# by finding every `#[test]`/`#[tokio::test]`-attributed function name across the caller-facing
# modules this script reads, and matching it against BOTH the limit_kind's own name tokens and its
# Rust constant's name tokens (a test is very likely to be named after one or the other; requiring
# only one of the two token sets, not literal substring equality, tolerates paraphrasing like
# "per_connection_presence_ceiling" for `presence_entries_per_connection`).
#
# Matching is whole-word (both sides split on `_`, never raw substring) and singular/plural
# insensitive (a trailing "s" is stripped before comparing), because Rust test names paraphrase
# freely: `user_connections`'s own tokens are {user, connections} but the real test is named
# `per_user_connection_ceiling_is_enforced_and_freed_on_unregister` (singular "connection"), and
# `slow_consumer_queue_frames`'s tokens include "frames" while its test says "queue_frame_ceiling"
# (singular "frame"). A required token set must be a SUBSET of the candidate test name's own token
# set for a match -- every token has to land on some whole word in the test name, in any order.
# This is intentionally not "any one token matches": that would let an unrelated test like
# `connection_registry_smoke` match every *_connections limit_kind through the word "connection"
# alone, without the specific "user"/"document"/"workspace" qualifier that makes it real coverage.

# every run -- never a fixed verdict:
#   1. `wired`: `collab_core::limits::check_operation`/`check_operation_batch_count` has a real,
#      non-comment call site in apps/api/src/flow/command.rs (CALL_SITES, from the static regex
#      count above -- doc-comment references like `[`check_operation`]` don't match it because
#      they're never followed immediately by `(`).
#   2. `crate_ok`: the crate-internal exact/+1 unit test for this limit_kind
#      (crates/collab-core/src/limits.rs::tests) currently passes.
#   3. `call_direction_ok`: at least one *call-direction* boundary test -- one that goes through
#      an actual caller-facing endpoint (the REST command handler in routes/flow.rs, and/or the
#      WebSocket write path via flow/collab/write.rs's `submit`/`accept_update`) rather than only
#      exercising the limits module directly -- exists AND currently passes for this limit_kind.
#      A passing crate-internal unit test alone is explicitly NOT sufficient for `passed`: that is
#      exactly the gap this whole verifier exists to catch (a check that is correct in isolation
#      but never reachable from any real request).
# `passed` requires all three. Any one of them being false keeps the case `failed`, with the
# reason built from whichever piece(s) actually failed -- so the prose can never describe a state
# ("0 call sites" / "not wired") that contradicts what the case's own evidence just measured.

# ---- self-consistency assertion: a case's reason may never contradict its own evidence ----
#
# This is the exact bug this script shipped with until 2026-08-30: every boundary_case's `status`
# was a hardcoded string literal (`"failed"`), so when `check_operation`/`check_operation_batch_count`
# actually got wired into apps/api/src/flow/command.rs, the dynamically-computed
# `call_sites_in_apps_api_command_rs` evidence field correctly flipped from 0 to a positive count --
# but the hand-written prose right next to it, in the SAME case object, kept reading "has 0 call
# sites ... not wired into any endpoint". A verifier able to assert those two things in the same
# breath is not trustworthy input to a release decision, and no amount of fixing individual
# `status` computations (above) rules out some future case, or some future edit to one of these
# case()-building blocks, reintroducing the same drift by accident. So this check runs
# unconditionally, on every run, on the actual objects this script is about to write out -- not on
# the code that built them -- and refuses to write evidence at all if it ever finds one.
#
# It looks for two specific self-contradicting phrase families in `reason` text ("zero/0/never/
