# End-to-End Test Script
# Rebuilds the compose environment from scratch, runs all tests, and tears it
# down again.
#
# THIS SCRIPT DESTROYS AND RECREATES THE LOCAL TEST ENVIRONMENT.
# It runs `docker compose down -v` both before and after the test run, which
# deletes the `pgdata` volume of THIS compose project (the openpr stack defined
# by ./docker-compose.yml). Volumes belonging to any other project are never
# touched. The up-front reset is what makes the script repeatable: test-api.sh
# registers the very first account of an empty database, and registration is
# admin-only once a user exists, so a leftover database from a previous run
# would fail the second run.
#
# Environment variables:
#   OPENPR_E2E_ASSUME_YES=1  skip the interactive confirmation of the reset
#   OPENPR_E2E_KEEP_STACK=1  leave the stack running afterwards (for debugging);
#                            the next run still starts from a clean database
